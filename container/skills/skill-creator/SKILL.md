# Skill Creator

Create skills following the Anthropic standard. Skills are modular packages with a SKILL.md and optional bundled resources (scripts, references, assets).

## Skill Anatomy

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          (required - YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions)
├── scripts/          (optional - executable code)
├── references/       (optional - docs loaded into context as needed)
└── assets/           (optional - files used in output, not loaded into context)
```

### SKILL.md Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does AND when to trigger it. This is the primary triggering mechanism — include all "when to use" info here, not in the body.
---
```

- `name`: hyphen-case, lowercase, max 64 chars
- `description`: max 1024 chars, no angle brackets. Be comprehensive about triggers.

### Body

Instructions for using the skill. Keep under 500 lines. Use imperative form.

## Core Principles

1. **Concise is key** — Claude is already smart. Only add context it doesn't have. Prefer examples over explanations.
2. **Progressive disclosure** — Keep SKILL.md lean. Move detailed reference material to `references/` files and link from SKILL.md.
3. **Match freedom to fragility** — Strict scripts for fragile operations, flexible guidance for open-ended tasks.
4. **No auxiliary files** — No README.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc. Only files the agent needs.

## Design Patterns

- **Multi-step processes**: See [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md)
- **Output format/quality standards**: See [references/output-patterns.md](references/output-patterns.md)

## Skill Storage

All skills live in the Obsidian vault at `/workspace/extra/vault/NanoClaw/skills/`. This is the canonical location — always read from and write to this path. The copies at `.claude/skills/` are ephemeral (loaded at container start) and should not be edited.

## Updating an Existing Skill

Edit files directly at `/workspace/extra/vault/NanoClaw/skills/<skill-name>/`. Changes persist via Obsidian Sync and take effect on the next container start.

## Creation Process

### 1. Understand the skill

Ask what functionality to support, get concrete usage examples, identify triggers.

### 2. Plan contents

For each example, identify what reusable scripts, references, or assets would help.

### 3. Initialize

```bash
bash .claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.sh <skill-name>
```

This creates the skill in the Obsidian vault (synced across devices). Skills are loaded from the vault on each container start, so new skills will be available in the next session.

### 4. Edit

- Implement scripts, references, assets identified in step 2
- Delete unneeded example files from init
- Write SKILL.md with comprehensive frontmatter description and concise body
- Test any scripts by running them

### 5. Validate

```bash
bash .claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/validate_skill.sh /workspace/extra/vault/NanoClaw/skills/<skill-name>
```

### 6. Iterate

Use the skill on real tasks, notice struggles, update accordingly.

## Removing a Skill

Delete the skill directory to remove it:

```bash
rm -rf /workspace/extra/vault/NanoClaw/skills/<skill-name>
```

The skill will no longer be available in future sessions. Active sessions retain skills already loaded into context.
